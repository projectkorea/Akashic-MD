# Reset Demystified

- `git reset`
- `git checkout`

An easier way to think about reset and checkout is through the mental frame of Git being a content manager of three different trees.

## The Three Trees

- By **tree** here, we really mean **collection of files**, not specifically the data structure
- Git as a system manages and manipulates three trees in its normal operation

|       Tree        |               Role                |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|       HEAD        | Last commit snapshot, next parent |
|       Index       |   Proposed next commit snapshot   |
| Working Directory |              Sandbox              |

### 1. Head

HEAD is the **pointer to the current branch reference**, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch. That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created. It’s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of your last commit on that branch.

In fact, it’s pretty easy to see what that snapshot looks like. Here is an example of getting the actual directory listing and SHA-1 checksums for each file in the HEAD snapshot:

```
$ git cat-file -p HEAD
tree cfda3bf379e4f8dba8717dee55aab78aef7f4daf
author Scott Chacon  1301511835 -0700
committer Scott Chacon  1301511835 -0700

initial commit

$ git ls-tree -r HEAD
100644 blob a906cb2a4a904a152...   README
100644 blob 8f94139338f9404f2...   Rakefile
040000 tree 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19...   lib
```

### 2. The Index

- The index is your **proposed next commit**. We’ve also been referring to this concept as Git’s “Staging Area” as this is what Git looks at when you run git commit.

Git populates this index with a list of all the file contents that were last checked out into your working directory and what they looked like when they were originally checked out. You then replace some of those files with new versions of them, and git commit converts that into the tree for a new commit.

### 3. The Working Directory

Finally, you have your working directory (also commonly referred to as the “working tree”). The other two trees store their content in an efficient but inconvenient manner, inside the .git folder. The working directory unpacks them into actual files, which makes it much easier for you to edit them. Think of the working directory as a sandbox, where you can try changes out before committing them to your staging area (index) and then to history.

Git’s typical workflow is to record snapshots of your project in successively better states, by manipulating these three trees.

## The Role of Reset

### Step 1: Move HEAD

The first thing `reset` will do is move what HEAD points to. This isn’t the same as changing HEAD itself (which is what `checkout` does); `reset` moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to. This means if HEAD is set to the master branch (i.e. you’re currently on the master branch), running `git reset 9e5e6a4` will start by making master point to 9e5e6a4.

### Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)

Note that if you run git status now you’ll see in green the difference between the index and what the new HEAD is.

The next thing reset will do is to update the index with the contents of whatever snapshot HEAD now points to.

If you specify the --mixed option, reset will stop at this point. This is also the default, so if you specify no option at all (just git reset HEAD~ in this case), this is where the command will stop.

Now take another second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it still undid your last commit, but also unstaged everything. You rolled back to before you ran all your git add and git commit commands.
