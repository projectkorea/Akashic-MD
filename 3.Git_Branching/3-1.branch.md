# 3.1 Branches in a Nutshell

### Git branches

- Incredibly **lightweight**
- Making branching operations nearly **instantaneous**
- switching back and forth between branches generally just as **fast**.
- Git doesn’t store data as a series of change-sets or differences, but instead as **a series of snapshots**.

## Creating a New Branch

### 1. `git branch <testing>`

- Two branches pointing into the same series of commits

- This creates **a new pointer** to the same commit you’re currently on.
- The git branch command only created a new branch — it didn’t switch to that branch.

How does Git know what branch you’re currently on? It keeps a special pointer called **HEAD**. Note that this is a lot different than the concept of HEAD in other VCSs you may be used to, such as Subversion or CVS. In Git, **this is a pointer to the local branch you’re currently on**. In this case, you’re still on master. The git branch command only created a new branch — it didn’t switch to that branch.

### 2.`git log --oneline --decorate`

```
f30ab (HEAD -> master, testing) Add feature #32 - ability to add new formats to the central interface
34ac2 Fix bug #1328 - stack overflow under certain conditions
98ca9 Initial commit
```

- HEAD pointing to a branch

`--decorate`: You can easily see this by running a simple git log command that **shows you where the branch pointers are pointing**.

## Switching Branches

### 1. `git checkout testing`

To switch to an existing branch, you run the git checkout command. Let’s switch to the new testing branch:
This moves HEAD to point to the testing branch.

### 2.`git commit -a -m 'made a change'`

- `testing` branch has **moved forward**, but your master branch still points to the commit you were on when you ran git checkout to switch branches.

### 3. `git checkout master`

- HEAD moves when you checkout

- That command did two things.
  1. It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the master branch
  2. It reverted the files in your working directory back to the snapshot that master points to. This also means the changes you make from this point forward will diverge from an older version of the project. It essentially rewinds the work you’ve done in your testing branch so you can go in a different direction.

#### Switching branches changes files in your working directory

- It’s important to note that when you switch branches in Git, files in your working directory will change. If you switch to an older branch, your working directory will be reverted to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch. If Git cannot do it cleanly, it will not let you switch at all.

### 4. `git commit -a -m 'made other changes'`

- Now the project history has diverged (see Divergent history)

- You created and switched to a branch, did some work on it, and then switched back to your main branch and did other work. Both of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the branches and merge them together when you’re ready. And you did all that with simple branch, checkout, and commit commands.

#### branches are cheap to create and destroy

- A branch in Git is actually **a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to**
- Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).

This is in sharp contrast to the way most older VCS tools branch, which involves copying all of the project’s files into a second directory. This can take several seconds or even minutes, depending on the size of the project, whereas in Git the process is always instantaneous. Also, because we’re recording the parents when we commit, finding a proper merge base for merging is automatically done for us and is generally very easy to do. These features help encourage developers to create and use branches often.

#### Creating a new branch and switching to it at the same time

- It’s typical to create a new branch and want to switch to that new branch at the same time — this can be done in one operation with `git checkout -b <newbranchname>`

#### From Git version 2.23 onwards you can use git switch instead of git checkout to:

- Switch to an existing branch: git switch testing-branch.
- Create a new branch and switch to it: git switch -c new-branch. The -c flag stands for create, you can also use the full flag: --create.
- Return to your previously checked out branch: git switch -.
