# What is Git?

- 다른 VCS과 달리 Git은 데이터를 생각하는 방법이 다르다.

### 다른 VCS의 저장 방식

- Most other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on)

1. Copied from the previous generation
2. Storing data as changes to a _base version of each file_

- Store information as a **list of file-based changes**.
- Store as a set of files and the changes made to **each file over time**
- This is commonly described as **delta-based version control**

### GIT의 저장방식

1. Snapshots, Not Differences
2. Storing data as snapshots of the project over time

Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of **snapshots of a miniature filesystem**. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores **a reference to that snapshot**.

- To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.

- a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS.
